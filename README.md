# Invasion : Code Name X

##### Team 7 : White Midi 

- Xie Shaokang

- Xiong Muxin

- Yang Yixuan

  

### Basic Operations

- ***WASD*** for basic movement

- ***Left Click*** for shooting
- ***M*** to build your own tower
  - Each purchased tower demands **200 money** and you will gradually gain money with time goes by.
- ***Q*** to shoot with a special bullet
  - The special bullet can hurt the turret with much more power but it need **3 second** to cooldown.
- ***Esc*** to quit the game



### Network Connecting

For better gaming experience, we set up 9 server and one for each team, so two of each team can download the specific EXE file in QQ group or onedrive and play.



### Objective

Break the crystal after destroying the turrets.



### Bug Exist

For our limited ability, there are still some bugs in our games. 

- When network stuck, the bullets spawned from the turret or crystal would travel in a ridiculously low speed.

- Because network delay, the client's bullet may suffer from delaying problem, making it seem like not spawn from the client hero's body.
- The collision of the client's wall may seem like a bit larger than it should be.
